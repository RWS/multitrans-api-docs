Anyone is welcome to contribute to the public MultiTrans API documentation by making a pull request into the master repository. The documentation is split into the following sections: Articles This section hosts a series of usefull article on: how to best use the public APIs how to troubleshoot common issues API Concepts This section hosts the main guidelines on using the Public API along with the API References Getting started with your contribution The documentation is built using a static documentation generator called DocFX. The documentation content is saved in Markdown files and then built into a website using DocFX. The table of content is saved into separate toc.yml files. In order for you to make a contribution directly please follow the next steps: Create a local branch from the main repository Add your changes by modifying existing Markdown files or by adding new Markdown files Adding new files will require updating the toc.yml files. Use the guideline provided by DocFX to learn more. You can use tools such as Notepad++ or Visual Studio Code to edit the content Create a Pull Request with your changes. This pull request will be reviewed for correctness by one of our technical writers Once your pull request has been approved and committed into the main branch, an automatic pipeline will be triggered which will push your changes to the live documentation site if you wish to test your changes locally you can follow the DOCFX Installation guideline and build the entire solution locally Our documentation automatically fills in the product name and other details so you don't have to make the changes manually if we decide to update the product name. Use the 'var:VariableName' construct to tell our documentation engine to fill in the info for you. Here are the constructs available at this point: <var:ProductName> - The product name, for example multitrans <var:ProductNameWithEdition> - The official product release name including the edition, for example 'MultiTrans 7'"

    "summary": "MultiTrans API Documentation MultiTrans RESTful Web Services The MultiTrans REST API allows external systems to create translation projects programmatically in the MultiTrans TMS, to retrieve statuses of those projects and to retrieve the final translated documents. Various other information can also be retrieved or managed through the API, including retrieving and accepting quotes and retrieving or updating details on projects and tasks. The MultiTrans REST API is documented and can be tested through Swagger, directly on your MultiTrans server. Technical Documentation The technical documentation for the MultiTrans API is split into five sections: Accessing Sample Code Swagger documentation is available to authenticated users, to provide sample code to assist in development. Supported file types The REST API does not process the contents of files, so the only restrictions on file types are those blocklisted by the MultiTrans server. Because the file contents are not processed, the restrictions are based on the file extensions. Available methods The available methods described here give an overview of the functionality available using the MultiTrans REST API. For the full details required for development, refer to your Swagger environment for sample code. Uploading documents For any method in which documents are uploaded to MultiTrans, the documents can be uploaded using a URL, a file path or via Base64. When uploading documents using a URL or a file path, MultiTrans must have access to the URL or the path. Mapping languages MultiTrans supports ISO 639-3 (example ENG, FRA) and RFC 3066 (example en-CA and de-CH) language codes. If the system connecting to the MultiTrans TMS uses language codes other than these, a map file must be configured and placed on the server to convert the language codes on demand.
